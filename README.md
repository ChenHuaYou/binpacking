# Bin Packing
This package contains greedy algorithms to solve two typical bin packing problems. Consider you have a list of items, each carrying a weight *w_i*. Typical questions are

1. How can we distribute the items to a minimum number of bins *N* of equal volume *V*?
2. How can we distribute the items to exactly *N* bins where each carries items that sum up to approximately equal weight?
